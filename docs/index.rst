Graph Variable Solver
=================================================

Graph Variable Solver is a helper wrapper lying on top of Sympy that allows solving
complex variable networks in a sensible order.  Variables and relationships can be 
specified in a JSON input file and 

A console helper `solver.py` exists to make calling from the console easier.
